## Traffic Safety Analysis

### Overview
This project involves the analysis of New York City motor vehicle collision data to identify accident hotspots. The analysis supports the **Vision Zero** initiative, which aims to eliminate traffic-related fatalities and severe injuries in NYC.

### Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib/Seaborn
- Geospatial Libraries (e.g., Geopandas, Folium)
- Jupyter Notebooks

### Key Steps
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing of motor vehicle collision dataset.
2. Geospatial analysis to identify accident hotspots.
3. Visualization of accident locations and trends over time.
4. Recommendations to support the Vision Zero initiative.

### Results
- Identified high-risk accident areas.
- Visualized accident trends, time patterns, and hotspots.
- Provided actionable insights to support Vision Zero goals.

## Image Classification on CIFAR-10 Using CNN

### Overview
This project involves building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images into 10 categories from the **CIFAR-10** dataset. Additionally, data augmentation techniques were applied to improve model generalization and accuracy.

### Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

### Key Steps
1. Loaded and preprocessed the CIFAR-10 dataset.
2. Built a CNN model with multiple convolutional and pooling layers.
3. Implemented data augmentation to enhance model robustness.
4. Trained the model and evaluated its accuracy.

### Results
- Achieved improved accuracy using data augmentation techniques.
- Successfully classified images into 10 categories.
